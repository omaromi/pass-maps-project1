# pass-maps-project1

In diving deeper into soccer analytics, I found a great dataset through StatsBomb Open Data. I used their library [https://github.com/statsbomb/statsbombpy] as well as mplsoccer [https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html]

I was able to build all this in a weekend. Which honestly surprised me as well. Even more surprisingly, I spent more time cleaning the data and manipulating the DataFrames into the particular way I wanted more than I did actually writing the code to create figures from the data.

After being able to build one pass map through an example player of Marco Verratti, I was quickly able to make one for the entire team. Just through working on small projects like this, I feel I'm able to better understand the power of Python and Pandas over something like Excel which I have used extensively in the past.
